```
git clone https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus.git
cd Fooocus
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate fooocus
pip install -r requirements_versions.txt
```

Then download the models: download default models to the folder "Fooocus\models\checkpoints". Or let Fooocus automatically download the models using the launcher:

```
conda activate fooocus
python entry_with_update.py
```

Or, if you want to open a remote port, use

```
conda activate fooocus
python entry_with_update.py --listen
```

Use ```python entry_with_update.py --preset anime``` or ```python entry_with_update.py --preset realistic``` for Fooocus Anime/Realistic Edition.

### AMD GPUs

> [!NOTE]
> The AMD support is in beta.

# Usage

> [!NOTE]
> The following guide is based on the usage of Fooocus on a windows 11 machine using an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use AI-generated images responsibly: **Always disclose that they were generated by AI.**
> Be mindful of **intellectual property rights.**

## Before Starting

When using your image generation model, **it's essential to provide detailed and specific prompts to achieve the desired output**. A well-crafted prompt can make all the difference in generating an image that meets your needs.

To get started, try to be as descriptive as possible:

* ***Specify the object or scene you want to see***: "Generate a photo of a sunset on a beach".
* ***Provide context***: "Create an image of a futuristic cityscape with towering skyscrapers and flying cars".
* ***Add style guidance***: "Produce a minimalist illustration of a cat in a bold, comic book-style font".

By being **specific and detailed**, you'll help the model understand your vision and generate an output that aligns with your expectations. 

> [!TIP]
> You Check out this helpful [twitter/X account](https://twitter.com/nickfloats) to learn how to improve your skills. While this account is for Midjourney, its prompting principles can be applied to Fooocus. Take inspiration and adapt them to create compelling prompts.

## Basic Mode

To begin, simply execute the ```run.bat``` file (or use ```python entry_with_update.py``` on other platforms) to load the software and models.

Once loaded, Fooocus will open a tab in your browser, where you can start exploring its features. By default, you'll see an input box for writing prompts, a "Generate" button, and an image window.

**Starting Image Generation**

To generate images, simply type what you want to create into the input box and click the "Generate" button. Fooocus will then produce two images with a 9:7 ratio by default.

As the generation process unfolds, you'll be able to visualize the output in real-time within the image window.

**Saving and Viewing Generated Images**

Once the images are created, you can zoom in on them by clicking directly on the new images. To save your generated creations, use the dedicated button at the top of each image.


## Advanced Mode

For greater control over your image generation, toggle into Advanced Mode by clicking the corresponding button located below the input field. This mode offers a range of additional settings and options to fine-tune your creative output.

### Settings

In the Settings tab, you can refine your image generation experience by adjusting various options.

 * **Preset Selection** : Select a preset model optimized for a specific image style, such as Anime. This ensures that the model is tailored to produce images that match the chosen style.

 * **Performance Selection** : Choose a preset performance setting to focus on specific generation parameters, like Speed or quality. For example, if you need a highly detailed image, select the Quality option.

* **Aspect Ratio** : Choose from a list of pre-defined aspect ratios to control the shape and proportions of your generated images. Fooocus limits the ratio options to ensure better output results.

* **Number of Images** : Decide how many images you want the model to generate. It's often helpful to produce multiple iterations, as the output images may vary significantly. This allows you to choose your preferred result.

* **Output Format** : The default output format is PNG. You can also select JPEG or WebP formats to suit your needs.

* **Negative Prompt Box** : Use the negative prompt box to fine-tune your image output by removing unwanted objects, colors, or characters from the generated images. This feature enables you to further customize your results.

### Style

The Style tab allows you to **modify the aesthetic of your generated images**. To explore different styles, use the search box to find a specific style that suits your needs.

**Use the search box to quickly locate a specific style** that resonates with your creative vision. Once you've found the desired style, **adjust the settings as needed to refine the look** of your generated images.

Some examples of available styles include:

* **Minimalism** : A sleek and simple design
* **Rococo** : A ornate and decorative style inspired by 18th-century French art
* **Watercolor** : A soft and whimsical aesthetic reminiscent of watercolor paintings
* **Art Deco** : A glamorous and geometric style popularized in the Roaring Twenties

Fooocus offers a wide range of styles, each one carefully crafted to evoke a unique mood, atmosphere, or visual identity. Take some time to browse through the library and get familiar with what's available.

### Model

The Model tab provides advanced users with the ability to fine-tune the **underlying model and weights used by Fooocus**. While this level of customization can be powerful, it is essential to carefully consider any changes before making them.

Before modifying the model or weights, we strongly recommend that you have a solid understanding of the concepts involved.

<strong> If you are unsure about what you are doing, it is best to leave these settings unchanged. </strong>

</div>

### Advanced

The Advanced tab offers two settings, carefully developed by the Fooocus team, which provide additional control over your image generation process.

**Sharpness**

Fooocus introduces Image Sharpness, a feature designed to address the common issue of overly smooth images generated by SDXL. **This setting allows you to control the level of detail and sharpness** in your final image.

By adjusting the Image Sharpness value, you can achieve a range of effects:
* Higher values will result in **less smoothed images with more defined edges**.
* Lower values will **produce smoother, more subtle images**.
  
To get the most out of this feature, try experimenting with different settings to find the sweet spot that suits your creative vision. The default value is set to 2, providing a good balance between sharpness and smoothness.

**Guidance Scale**

The Guidance Scale, also known as the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scale, is a critical parameter that **controls how closely the image generation process follows your text prompt**.

As you increase the value of the CFG scale:

* The generated images will become more aligned with the original text prompt.
* However, be cautious not to set it too high, as this can limit diversity and quality in your output.
  
On the other hand, a **lower CFG scale value**:

* Allows for greater creative freedom and produces higher-quality images.
* May result in output that deviates from the original text prompt, but still maintains a strong connection to its essence.

**To get the most out of the Guidance Scale**:

* Experiment with different values to find the sweet spot that suits your creative vision.
* Consider the trade-off between prompt adherence and creative freedom when setting this parameter.
* Don't be afraid to adjust the CFG scale value to achieve the perfect balance for your project.

## Input Image

The Input Image option allows you to **leverage images as input for your generation process, offering a powerful way to guide and refine your creative output.**

There are several scenarios where using images as input can be particularly useful.

### Upscaling
