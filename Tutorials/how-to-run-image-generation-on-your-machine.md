## Introduction

Running AI image generation models like Stable Diffusion directly on your own computer offers significant advantages over relying solely on online services. This local approach grants you complete creative control, ensures privacy as your data and creations stay on your machine, and removes limitations often found in cloud-based platforms, such as usage restrictions or content filters. It allows for unrestricted experimentation with different models, styles, prompts, and generation parameters.

This guide will walk you through setting up and using three popular interfaces for local image generation, each catering to different levels of user experience and desired control:

*   **Fooocus:** Designed for simplicity and ease of use, great for beginners or those wanting quick results with minimal setup.
*   **AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion web UI:** A feature-rich interface offering extensive options and community extensions, popular among intermediate users who want more control.
*   **ComfyUI:** A powerful node-based system providing maximum flexibility and customization for advanced users and complex workflows.

## Hardware Requirement

To run Image generation on your machine, your hardware configuration **must meet these specifications for optimal performance.** Lower specifications may impact generation speed and quality.

## Find the Model that is right for you

Choosing the right model is key to getting the results you want. 

### High-quality models to beggin with

*   **[Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)](https://civitai.com/models/101055/sd-xl)** (Good for most styles)
*   **[Pony](https://civitai.com/models/257749/pony-diffusion-v6-xl)** (best for Anime/Comics style)
*   **[Illustrious XL](https://civitai.com/models/1224788/prefect-illustrious-xl)** (best for Anime/Manga style)
*   **[Flux.1 Dev](https://civitai.com/models/618692/flux)** (best for photorealism)

### Where to Find Models

*   [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-to-image&sort=trending): A major hub for AI models. Excellent source for official base models (SDXL, SD3, etc.) and many research models. Search for text-to-image models.
*   [**Civitai**](https://civitai.com/): The most popular community site specifically for Stable Diffusion models. Huge collection of user-created Checkpoints, LoRAs, Embeddings, VAEs, etc., with image examples and reviews. **Caution:** Content can be NSFW; use filters if needed. Check model licenses.
*   [**OpenModelDB**](https://openmodeldb.info/): A database focused on upscaling models, often hosting various types like ESRGAN.

**Understanding these different components will help you navigate the vast options available and combine them effectively to achieve your creative vision.**

The Stable Diffusion ecosystem involves several types of model files that work together. Here's a breakdown:
### Understanding the different model files
### 1. Checkpoints / Base Models (`.ckpt` or `.safetensors`)

*   **What they are:** These are the large, foundational models (often several gigabytes). They contain the core knowledge and artistic style learned during training. Think of them as the "brain" of the image generation process.
*   **Purpose:** Switching checkpoints is the primary way to drastically change the overall style, capability, or subject focus (e.g., photorealistic, anime, fantasy art).
*   **Examples:** Models are often based on architectures like Stable Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5), SDXL (Stable Diffusion XL), Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), or others like PixArt, Pony, etc. 

**Many popular checkpoints are fine-tunes of these base architectures, specialized for certain styles or subjects (e.g., Juggernaut XL, DreamShaper).**

### 2. Modifiers & Fine-tuners

These smaller files work *with* a base checkpoint to modify or add specific elements:

*   **LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) (`.safetensors`)**
    *   **What they are:** Much smaller files (typically megabytes) that apply targeted adjustments to a checkpoint.
    *   **Purpose:** Used to add specific artistic styles, characters, objects, clothing concepts, or poses without needing a whole new checkpoint. You can often combine multiple LoRAs, adjusting their influence (weight).
*   **Embeddings / Textual Inversions (`.pt` or `.bin`)**
    *   **What they are:** Tiny files (kilobytes) that teach the model a new keyword associated with a specific visual concept (often a style or a specific person/object).
    *   **Purpose:** Activated by using their specific trigger word(s) in your prompt to invoke the learned concept. Less impactful on overall style than LoRAs, more focused on specific entities.

### 3. Utility Models

These models perform specific helper tasks within the generation workflow:

*   **VAEs (Variational Auto Encoders) (`.safetensors` or `.pt`)**
    *   **What they are:** Models responsible for translating the abstract "latent image" generated by Stable Diffusion into the actual pixels you see, and vice-versa for image-to-image tasks.
    *   **Purpose:** While checkpoints often include a default VAE, using a different VAE can subtly (or sometimes significantly) alter the final image's colors, saturation, and fine details. Sometimes required for specific checkpoints.
*   **Upscaling Models (`.pth` or `.safetensors`)**
    *   **What they are:** Dedicated models designed specifically to increase image resolution while adding detail (or attempting to preserve it).
    *   **Purpose:** Used in post-processing (like the Extras tab in A1111) or integrated into workflows (like Hires. Fix or ComfyUI nodes) to generate larger, higher-quality images. Examples include ESRGAN, SwinIR, 4x-UltraSharp.
*   **ControlNet Models (`.pth` or `.safetensors`)**
    *   **What they are:** Models that condition the image generation process based on an input image or map (like a depth map, pose skeleton, edge detection map, etc.).
    *   **Purpose:** Allow for much finer control over the composition, pose, or structure of the generated image, making the output conform closely to the ControlNet input. Requires specific software support (Extensions in A1111, nodes in ComfyUI).

## Fooocus (Beginner)

Fooocus is an open-source AI image generation tool that simplifies the use of Stable Diffusion, making it accessible for users to create high-quality visuals. It requires minimal setup and can run on systems with a GPU (Nvidia) with 4GB of memory and 8GB of RAM.

### Installation

1.  Download the Fooocus files from its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus).
2.  Extract the downloaded files to your desired location on your computer (e.g., your desktop).
3.  Locate and run the `run.bat` file (for Windows). This will initiate the download and installation of necessary files, including the default Stable Diffusion XL model (e.g., Juggernaut XL). The first time you run it, it will download a checkpoint file which contains the image data. This might take some time.
4.  Once the setup is complete, a web page (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7865/`) will automatically open in your default web browser. This is the Fooocus interface where you can begin generating images.

Alternatively, you can use online platforms that host Fooocus (like Google Colab notebooks, or services like MimicPC) to run it without a local installation, though local installation gives you more control.

official troubleshooting guide [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/blob/main/troubleshoot.md).

### Basic Image Generation

1.  Once Fooocus is running and the web interface is open, you'll see a prominent prompt input field at the bottom of the page.
2.  Type a detailed description of the image you want to create into this prompt box. For example: "a photorealistic portrait of an astronaut cat exploring a vibrant alien jungle, detailed fur, glowing plants".
3.  Click the "Generate" button. Fooocus will then process your prompt and generate images based on it. By default, it usually generates two images per prompt.

### Advanced Options

To access more granular controls and fine-tune your image generation, click the "Advanced" checkbox, typically located at the bottom of the interface, near the prompt input.

#### Key Advanced Settings:

*   **Performance Settings**:
    *   Located under the "Speed" tab (or similar).
    *   Adjust the trade-off between generation speed and image quality.
    *   Options typically include:
        *   **Speed**: Faster generation with a moderate number of steps (e.g., 30 steps). Good for quick iterations.
        *   **Quality**: Slower generation with more steps (e.g., 60 steps), often resulting in higher detail.
        *   **Extreme Speed**: Very fast generation with fewer steps (e.g., 8 steps), useful for rapid prototyping but may sacrifice quality.

*   **Aspect Ratios**:
    *   Found under the "Advanced" tab or near the prompt.
    *   Choose the desired dimensions and orientation for your output images (e.g., 1:1 square, 16:9 widescreen, 9:16 portrait). The same prompt can produce significantly different compositions based on this setting.

*   **Number of Images**:
    *   Also under the "Advanced" tab.
    *   Specify how many images you want Fooocus to generate at once for a single prompt (e.g., 1, 2, 4).

*   **Negative Prompt**:
    *   A separate input field within the "Advanced" options.
    *   Input terms for elements, styles, or artifacts you want to *exclude* from your image. For instance, you can add "ugly, tiling, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn feet, poorly drawn face, out of frame, extra limbs, disfigured, deformed, body out of frame, blurry, bad anatomy, blurred, watermark, grainy, signature, cut off, draft, low quality, noise, text, words" to improve results.

*   **Style**:
    *   Found under the "Style" tab.
    *   Fooocus offers a wide range of predefined styles. You can select multiple styles to combine their effects.
    *   Examples: "Fooocus V2", "Fooocus Enhance", "Fooocus Sharp", "Photorealistic", "Cinematic", "Anime", "Impressionism", etc. Experiment with these to drastically change the look and feel of your images.

*   **Model Selection**:
    *   Under the "Model" tab.
    *   **Base Model**: Choose the primary Stable Diffusion model Fooocus will use (e.g., JuggernautXL, SDXL Base). You can download additional models and place them in the `Fooocus\models\checkpoints` folder.
    *   **Refiner Model**: Optionally, select a refiner model that can enhance the details of the generated image. This is often used in a second pass.
    *   **LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations)**: Select up to five LoRAs. LoRAs are smaller, fine-tuned models that can add specific styles, characters, or concepts. You can adjust the weight (influence) of each LoRA. Place LoRA files in `Fooocus\models\loras`.

*   **Advanced Tab (Fine-tuning)**:
    *   **Guidance Scale (CFG Scale)**: Controls how strictly the AI adheres to your prompt. Lower values (e.g., 4-7) give the AI more creative freedom, while higher values (e.g., 7-12) make it follow the prompt more closely. Default is often around 7.
    *   **Image Sharpness**: Adjusts the clarity and detail of edges in the image. Lower settings produce softer, potentially blurrier edges, while higher settings create sharper images. Often a subtle effect.
    *   **Sampler & Scheduler**: These are more technical settings that determine how the noise is iteratively removed to form an image. For most users, the defaults work well. Common samplers include `dpmpp_2m_sde_gpu` and schedulers like `karras`.

### Image-to-Image Generation (Input Image)

Fooocus allows you to use existing images as a basis for new creations. Click the "Input Image" checkbox (usually below the prompt area) to reveal these features. This will open up several tabs: "Upscale or Variation", "Image Prompt", and "Inpaint or Outpaint".

#### Input Image Features:

*   **Upscale or Variation**:
    *   Upload an image to this section.
    *   **Vary (Subtle/Strong)**: Generate new versions of an uploaded image. "Subtle" makes minor changes, while "Strong" introduces more significant alterations while trying to retain the core subject.
    *   **Upscale (e.g., 1.5x, 2x, Fast 2x)**: Increase the resolution of an uploaded image. For example, the "Upscale (Fast 2x)" option is optimized for enlarging images like 2k to 4k. Select an option and click "Generate".

*   **Image Prompt**:
    *   Upload up to four reference images. These images, along with your text prompt, will guide the generation of new images.
    *   You can control the influence of each image prompt using options like "PyraCanny" (edge detection), "CPDS" (detail preservation), or "FaceSwap" (if you have a face in the image prompt and want to apply it).
    *   Adjust the "Stop At" and "Weight" parameters to control how much each image prompt influences the final result.

*   **Inpaint or Outpaint**:
    *   Upload an image. The interface will allow you to draw a mask over the image.
    *   **Inpainting**: Modify or add details *within* the selected (masked) area of an image. Provide a prompt describing what you want in the masked area (e.g., "add a red hat").
    *   **Outpainting**: Extend the image beyond its original borders. Mask the area *outside* the part you want to keep, or use the "Outpaint Direction" buttons. The AI will predict and generate the new areas based on your prompt and the existing image.
    *   You can choose the method (e.g., "Inpaint" or "Improve Detail").
    *   After setting up your image, mask, and prompt, click "Generate".

### Tips for Better Results

*   **Be Specific in Prompts**: The more detail you provide, the better Fooocus can understand your vision. Think about subject, action, environment, lighting, style, and composition.
*   **Iterate**: Don't expect the perfect image on the first try. Generate multiple images, pick the ones you like, and refine your prompts or use image-to-image features.
*   **Experiment with Styles**: The "Style" tab is very powerful. Combining a few well-chosen styles can dramatically improve your output.
*   **Use Negative Prompts**: This is crucial for avoiding common AI artifacts and unwanted elements.
*   **Check the Console**: If `run.bat` is still open in a command prompt window, it often shows progress and any errors, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.
*   **Update Fooocus**: The software is actively developed. Pull the latest updates from GitHub regularly to get new features and bug fixes by running `update.bat` or `git pull` if you cloned the repository.

## AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion web UI (Intermediate)

AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion Web UI (often abbreviated as A1111) is a popular browser-based interface for Stable Diffusion, a powerful AI model that generates images from text descriptions or modifies existing images based on prompts. It is known for its extensive features and is a go-to tool for users who want more control over their AI image generation. While packed with options, this guide will help you understand its core functionalities.

### Installation

Before using AUTOMATIC1111, you need to set it up on your system. The process generally involves installing Python, Git, and then downloading the Web UI files. For users with Nvidia GPUs, installing CUDA and cuDNN is highly recommended for faster image generation, though the Web UI can run on CPU as well (much slower).

**Steps for Installation (Windows Example):**
1.  **Set Up Python**: Install a compatible version of Python (check the A1111 GitHub page for recommended versions, typically Python 3.10.x). Ensure you add Python to your system's PATH during installation.
2.  **Install Git**: Download and install Git for Windows from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
3.  **Download AUTOMATIC1111**:
    *   Open Command Prompt (cmd).
    *   Navigate to your desired installation directory. For example, to install in your user profile: `cd %userprofile%` and press Enter.
    *   Clone the repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui.git` and pressing Enter. This will create a `stable-diffusion-webui` folder in your chosen directory.
4.  **Add a Model File (Checkpoint)**:
    *   Navigate to the `stable-diffusion-webui\models\Stable-diffusion` folder within your installation directory.
    *   Download a Stable Diffusion model checkpoint file (e.g., `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors` for Stable Diffusion 1.5, or an SDXL base model like `sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors`). You can find models on sites like Hugging Face or Civitai. Place the `.ckpt` or `.safetensors` file in this folder.
5.  **Run AUTOMATIC1111**:
    *   In File Explorer, go to the `stable-diffusion-webui` folder.
    *   Double-click the `webui-user.bat` file.
    *   A command prompt window will open and start the setup process, downloading necessary dependencies. This might take a while on the first run.
    *   Once it's ready, you'll see a message similar to: `Running on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860`.
    *   Open this URL in your web browser to access the AUTOMATIC1111 interface.

### Interface Overview

The AUTOMATIC1111 Web UI is organized into several key areas:

*   **Top Row**:
    *   **Stable Diffusion checkpoint**: Dropdown to select your primary model.
    *   **Tabs**: `txt2img`, `img2img`, `Extras`, `PNG Info`, `Checkpoint Merger`, `Train`, `Settings`, `Extensions`.

*   **Main Generation Area (e.g., `txt2img` tab)**:
    *   **Prompt Input**: Fields for your "Prompt" (what you want to see) and "Negative prompt" (what you want to avoid).
    *   **Generation Parameters**: Sliders and input boxes for settings like:
        *   Sampling method
        *   Sampling steps
        *   Width & Height
        *   Batch count & Batch size
        *   CFG Scale
        *   Seed
    *   **Generate Button**: The large orange button to start image generation.
    *   **Output Area**: Where generated images appear, along with options to save them or send them to other tabs.

You can change the default white theme to a dark theme by appending `?__theme=dark` to the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860/?__theme=dark`). This can also be set permanently in the Settings tab.

### Text-to-Image (`txt2img`) Tab

The `txt2img` tab is where you'll typically start, turning text prompts into images.

#### Basic Usage:
1.  **Select Checkpoint**: Choose your desired Stable Diffusion model from the "Stable Diffusion checkpoint" dropdown at the top left. If you've added new models to the `models\Stable-diffusion` folder, click the small blue refresh button next to the dropdown to update the list.
2.  **Enter Prompt**: In the "Prompt" text box, describe the image you want to create. Be specific.
    *   Example: `masterpiece, best quality, a majestic lion king sitting on a throne in a futuristic neon city, cinematic lighting`
    *   **Emphasis**: Use parentheses to increase or decrease a word's influence:
        *   `(word)`: increases attention by a factor of 1.1
        *   `((word))`: increases attention by a factor of 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21
        *   `[word]`: decreases attention
        *   `(word:1.5)`: increases attention by a factor of 1.5
3.  **Enter Negative Prompt**: In the "Negative prompt" text box, list elements you want to exclude.
    *   Example: `(worst quality, low quality:1.4), ugly, blurry, deformed, watermark, text, signature, extra limbs, disfigured face`
4.  **Set Dimensions**:
    *   **Width** and **Height**: Set the dimensions for your output image. For SD 1.5 models, common sizes are 512x512, 512x768, or 768x512. For SDXL models, 1024x1024 or similar resolutions are standard.
5.  **Configure Batch Options**:
    *   **Batch count**: How many times to run the generation process sequentially. If set to 4, it will generate images four times.
    *   **Batch size**: How many images to generate in parallel during each run. If set to 2, and Batch count is 1, it will generate 2 images.
    *   Total images = Batch count * Batch size.
6.  Click the orange **Generate** button. Your images will appear in the output area on the right (or below).

#### Key Generation Parameters:

*   **Sampling method**: Algorithm used for denoising. Popular choices:
    *   `Euler a` (ancestral): Good for creative results, changes a lot with step count.
    *   `DPM++ 2M Karras`: High quality, often recommended.
    *   `DPM++ SDE Karras`: Similar to 2M Karras, can be good for photorealism.
    *   `UniPC`: Fast and good quality.
    Experiment to find what works best for your style and model.
*   **Sampling steps**: Number of iterations.
    *   For `Euler a`: 20-40 steps.
    *   For `DPM++` samplers: 20-30 steps are often sufficient.
    *   More steps generally mean more detail but longer generation time. Diminishing returns after a certain point.
*   **CFG Scale (Classifier Free Guidance Scale)**: How strictly the AI should follow your prompt.
    *   Low values (e.g., 3-6): More creative, less adherence to prompt.
    *   Medium values (e.g., 7-10): Balanced. Default is often 7.
    *   High values (e.g., 11-15+): Strong adherence, but can lead to overly saturated or "burnt" images if too high.
*   **Seed**: The initial noise pattern.
    *   Value of `-1` (default): Uses a random seed for each generation, producing different images.
    *   Specific number: Using the same seed, prompt, and all other settings will reproduce the *exact* same image.
    *   **Dice icon (🎲️)**: Sets the seed to -1 (random).
    *   **Recycle icon (♻️)**: Reuses the seed from the *last generated image in the current batch*.

#### Other Useful `txt2img` Features:

*   **Hires. fix**: Generates a higher-resolution image. It first creates a smaller image based on your main Width/Height, then upscales it in a second pass using a selected upscaler (e.g., `Latent`, `R-ESRGAN 4x+`).
    *   **Upscaler**: Choose the algorithm for upscaling.
    *   **Hires steps**: Steps for the upscaling pass.
    *   **Denoising strength**: How much the upscaler should change the initial low-res image. Lower values preserve more of the original structure. (0.3-0.7 is a common range).
*   **Refiner (primarily for SDXL models)**: Uses a secondary "refiner" model to add details to an image generated by the base SDXL model.
    *   **Refiner Checkpoint**: Select your SDXL refiner model.
    *   **Switch at**: Determines at what percentage of the sampling steps the process switches from the base model to the refiner (e.g., 0.8 means 80% base, 20% refiner).
*   **Restore faces**: Applies face correction algorithms (like GFPGAN or CodeFormer) to improve faces in the generated image. Check the box to enable.
*   **Tiling**: Creates images that can be seamlessly tiled, useful for patterns and textures.

### Image-to-Image (`img2img`) Tab

This tab allows you to upload an existing image and transform it using a text prompt.

#### Sub-tabs within `img2img`:

*   **img2img (default)**:
    1.  Upload your source image.
    2.  Write a prompt describing the desired changes or the new scene.
    3.  Adjust **Denoising strength**: This is crucial. It controls how much the original image is altered.
        *   `0.0 - 0.3`: Minor changes, preserves original image structure well.
        *   `0.4 - 0.7`: Moderate changes, good balance for style transfer or significant alterations.
        *   `0.7 - 1.0`: Major changes, original image may become unrecognizable.
*   **Sketch**: Upload an image and draw a simple color sketch on top of it to guide the generation.
*   **Inpaint**: Modify specific parts of an image.
    1.  Upload your image. A mask brush will appear.
    2.  Paint over the area you want to change.
    3.  Write a prompt describing what you want *in the masked area*.
    4.  Configure settings:
        *   **Mask blur**: How much to blur the edges of the mask.
        *   **Mask mode**:
            *   `Inpaint masked`: Changes the masked area.
            *   `Inpaint not masked`: Changes everything *except* the masked area.
        *   **Masked content**:
            *   `fill`: Fills with average color of the image (good for removing objects).
            *   `original`: Starts from the original pixels in the masked area.
            *   `latent noise/nothing`: Fills with noise/black (good for generating something new).
        *   **Inpaint area**:
            *   `Whole picture`: Processes the entire image, considering the masked area.
            *   `Only masked`: Processes only the masked region, potentially faster but less context-aware. Set padding for better blending.
    5.  Adjust **Denoising strength** as in `img2img`.
*   **Inpaint sketch**: Similar to Inpaint, but you draw your changes directly with colors.
*   **Inpaint upload**: Upload an image and a separate black-and-white mask image.
*   **Batch**: Process multiple images from an input directory.

### Other Important Tabs & Features

*   **Extras Tab**:
    *   **Upscaling**: Contains tools to upscale single or multiple images. Select an upscaler (e.g., `R-ESRGAN 4x+`, `SwinIR`, `LDSR`) and scale factor.
    *   **GFPGAN/CodeFormer**: Dedicated tools for face restoration on uploaded images.
*   **PNG Info Tab**:
    *   Drag and drop a PNG image generated by A1111 into this tab.
    *   It will display all the generation parameters (prompt, negative prompt, seed, steps, model, etc.) embedded in the image.
    *   Buttons allow you to send these parameters directly to `txt2img` or `img2img`, making it easy to recreate or iterate on past work.

### Tips for Better Results

*   **Start Simple**: Don't use too many complex keywords or settings at once.
*   **Iterate**: Generate, observe, refine your prompt, adjust settings, and generate again.
*   **Study Prompts**: Look at prompts from images you like (e.g., on Civitai or other image sharing sites) to learn how others structure them.
*   **Use Negative Prompts Actively**: This is crucial for cleaning up common AI artifacts.
*   **Experiment with Samplers and Steps**: Different combinations yield different results.
*   **Master Denoising Strength (in img2img)**: This is key to controlling how much an input image is changed.
*   **Save Your Best Seeds**: If you get a great result, note down the seed and other parameters.
*   **Explore LoRAs and Embeddings**: These can add specific styles, characters, or concepts to your generations. Place LoRAs in `stable-diffusion-webui\models\Lora` and embeddings in `stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings`. Use them in your prompt by typing `<lora:filename:weight>` or the embedding's trigger word.

*   **CLIP Models**: `ComfyUI/models/clip/`
*   **Embeddings/Textual Inversions**: `ComfyUI/models/embeddings/`
*   **ControlNet Models**: `ComfyUI/models/controlnet/`
*   **Upscale Models**: `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models/`

*Note: You might need to create these subdirectories if they don't exist. Some custom nodes might look for models in different locations; refer to their specific documentation.*

### Basic Text-to-Image Workflow

![ComfyUI Basic Text-to-Image Workflow](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*naubOEteU23eMwPuhDb03w.png)

Let's start with the fundamental workflow - generating images from text prompts:

#### Step 1: Load a Checkpoint Model

1.  Add a "Load Checkpoint" node to your workspace.
2.  Select a Stable Diffusion model from the dropdown list. Models placed in the `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints/` directory will appear here. *(You might need to refresh ComfyUI or restart it after adding new models).*

#### Step 2: Set Up Text Prompts

1.  Add a "CLIP Text Encode" node.
2.  Connect it to the "CLIP" output from the "Load Checkpoint" node.
3.  In the CLIP Text Encode node, enter your positive prompt (what you want in the image).
4.  Add another "CLIP Text Encode" node for negative prompts (what you don't want).

#### Step 3: Create the Empty Latent Image

1.  Add an "Empty Latent Image" node.
2.  Set your desired width and height (e.g., 512x512).
3.  This defines your "canvas" for image generation.

#### Step 4: Set Up the Sampler

1.  Add a "KSampler" node.
2.  Connect:
    *   "model" to the "MODEL" output from "Load Checkpoint"
    *   "positive" to the output of your positive CLIP Text Encode
    *   "negative" to the output of your negative CLIP Text Encode
    *   "latent_image" to the output of "Empty Latent Image"
3.  Configure sampling parameters:
    *   **seed**: A number that determines randomness (same seed = reproducible results)
    *   **steps**: How many steps to run (20-30 is common)
    *   **cfg**: How closely to follow the prompt (7-12 is common)
    *   **sampler_name**: Choose a sampler algorithm (e.g., `Euler_a`, `dpmpp_2m`)
    *   **scheduler**: The noise schedule (e.g., `normal`, `karras`)

#### Step 5: Decode and Save the Image

1.  Add a "VAE Decode" node.
    *   Connect it to the "LATENT" output from KSampler.
    *   Connect its "vae" input to the "VAE" output from Load Checkpoint.
2.  Add a "Save Image" node.
    *   Connect it to the "IMAGE" output from "VAE Decode".

#### Step 6: Generate Your Image

Click the "Queue Prompt" button or press `Ctrl+Enter` to run your workflow.

### Image-to-Image Workflow

![ComfyUI Image-to-Image Workflow](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/img2img/img2img_workflow.png)

The image-to-image workflow allows you to modify existing images:

#### Step 1: Set Up the Basic Nodes

1.  Follow steps 1-2 from the text-to-image workflow to set up your model and text prompts.

#### Step 2: Load Your Input Image

1.  Add a "Load Image" node.
2.  Select your input image.

#### Step 3: Convert Image to Latent Space

1.  Add a "VAE Encode" node.
2.  Connect:
    *   "image" to the output of "Load Image"
    *   "vae" to the "VAE" output from "Load Checkpoint"

#### Step 4: Set Up the Sampler

1.  Add a "KSampler" node with connections similar to the text-to-image workflow.
2.  Important: Set "denoise" to less than 1.0 (e.g., 0.6-0.8) to preserve some of the original image.
    *   Lower values = closer to original image
    *   Higher values = more influenced by the prompt

#### Step 5: Decode and Save

Complete the workflow with "VAE Decode" and "Save Image" nodes as in the text-to-image workflow.

### Inpainting Workflow

Inpainting allows you to modify specific parts of an image while leaving the rest unchanged:

#### Step 1: Set Up the Base Workflow

1.  Load your model and set up text prompts as in previous workflows.

#### Step 2: Load and Prepare Your Image

1.  Add a "Load Image" node to load your base image.
2.  Create or load a mask for the areas you want to modify:
    *   Black areas = protected (unchanged)
    *   White areas = inpainted (changed)

#### Step 3: Create Masked Latent

1.  Add a "VAE Encode" node to convert your image to latent space.
2.  Add a "Set Latent Noise Mask" node.
3.  Connect:
    *   "latent" to the output of "VAE Encode"
    *   "mask" to your mask image

#### Step 4: Configure the Sampler

1.  Set up the "KSampler" node as in previous workflows.
2.  Connect the "latent_image" input to the output of "Set Latent Noise Mask".
3.  Set an appropriate denoise value (0.5-0.8 recommended).

#### Step 5: Decode and Save

Complete the workflow with "VAE Decode" and "Save Image" nodes as in previous workflows.

### Image Upscaling Methods in ComfyUI

ComfyUI offers multiple ways to upscale your generated images:

#### Method 1: Pixel Resampling

1.  Add an "Upscale Image By" node.
2.  Connect it to your image output.
3.  Select a scaling factor and method (e.g., `lanczos`, `nearest-neighbor`).
4.  This is fast but may result in less detail.

#### Method 2: SD Secondary Sampling Upscaling

1.  Create a basic workflow with "Load Checkpoint" and text encoding.
2.  Load your image and encode it to latent space.
3.  Add a "Latent Upscale" node to increase resolution in latent space.
4.  Use "KSampler" with a denoise value less than 1.0.
5.  Decode and save the upscaled image.
    *   This method can add new details but may slightly alter the image.

#### Method 3: Using Specialized Upscaling Models

![ComfyUI Image Upscaling Methods](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/upscale_models/esrgan_example.png)

1.  Load your image and a dedicated upscaling model.
2.  Apply the upscaling model to your image.
3.  This often provides the best quality but requires additional models.

### More ComfyUI Workflow Examples

The ComfyUI GitHub repository contains numerous examples of workflows for different tasks. You can find these examples in the dedicated [ComfyUI Examples](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI_examples) repository.

### Advanced Techniques

#### Using ControlNet

ControlNet allows for precise control over image generation based on various conditions like poses, depth maps, or edges:

1.  Add a "Load ControlNet Model" node and select the appropriate model (e.g., `openpose`, `canny`, `depth`).
2.  Add the corresponding preprocessor node (must match your ControlNet model).
3.  Connect:
    *   Your input image to the preprocessor
    *   The preprocessor output to an "Apply ControlNet" node
    *   The "Apply ControlNet" node between your conditioning and KSampler

ControlNet types include:
-   OpenPose: Control human poses
-   Canny: Follow edge detection
-   Depth: Maintain depth relationships
-   Lineart: Follow line drawings
-   Scribble: Generate from simple sketches
-   Segmentation: Follow segmentation masks

#### Batch Image Generation

To generate multiple images at once:

1.  Create your basic workflow.
2.  Add a "Latent From Batch" node.
3.  Configure it to generate multiple images in one run.
4.  Process the batch through your workflow.

Alternatively, use the "Image Batch" node to combine existing images into a batch for processing.

### Tips and Shortcuts

ComfyUI offers several shortcuts to speed up your workflow:

-   **Copy/Paste**: `Ctrl+C` to copy a node, `Ctrl+V` to paste.
-   **Move Multiple Nodes**: Hold `Ctrl` to select multiple nodes, then `Shift+drag`.
