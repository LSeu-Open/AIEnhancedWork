## Privately Use LLMs

### Run LLMs locally on your machine

**The most secure solution is to run your LLM model directly on your machine, ensuring that data never leaves the confines of your computer.**

<div align="center">
 
➡️ We have already created a tutorial on ***[how to run the model locally](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/AIEnhancedWork/blob/main/Tutorials/run-llms-locally-on-your-machine.md).*** ⬅️

</div>

<br>

The primary limitation of this option is that **it still requires minimal hardware to effectively run large and powerful models.**

The main benefit is that you have **full control over which model you use and how you use it**.

If you have an older or less powerful computer, or if you're not very familiar with computers, **the other two options might be a better fit for you.**
